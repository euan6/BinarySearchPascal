# BinarySearchPascal

In this pascal program, 2 arrays of length 100 are randomly generated with numbers between 1 and 100, they are then sorted useing insertion sorts ascending and descending. The one that is sorted ascending then lets you input a number which is what the user wants to search for. It will then display wether or not the number was found, and if it was, how many times it was found. The results are then stored in seperate text files, and the times for calculations are also stored in a seperate text file.
